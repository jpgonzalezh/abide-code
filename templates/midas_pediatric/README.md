This symmetric atlas has been created using 10 4-year old control cases plus inverted ones. 
Not only is the T1-weighted image provided (with and without skull), but also tissue segmentation probability maps (white matter, gray matter, CSF,rest), subcortical structures probability maps (amygdala, caudate,hippocampus, pallidus, putamen), and a 25-lobe parcellation map.
